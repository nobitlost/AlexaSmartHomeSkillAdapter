# AlexaSmartHomeSkill

This library provides a convenient way to implement the
 [Alexa Smart Home Skill API](https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/overviews/understanding-the-smart-home-skill-api) within an agent. It takes care of the JSON verification, data parsing and response formatting.

Supported requests are:

- Appliance discovery
- Device status query
- Device control
- System health check

**To add this library to your project, add** `#require "AlexaSmartHomeSkill.class.nut:1.0.0"` **to the top of your agent code**

## AlexaSmartHomeSkill Class Usage

### Constructor: AlexaSmartHomeSkill()

The constructor takes no parameters.

```squirrel
#require "AlexaSmartHomeSkill.class.nut:1.0.0"

mySkill <- AlexaSmartHomeSkill();
```

## AlexaSmartHomeSkill Class Methods

### registerAppliance(*applianceId, applianceInfo, actionCallback*)

This method makes the device accessible through the [Alexa Smart Home Skill API](https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/overviews/understanding-the-smart-home-skill-api).

*applianceId* specifies the device identifier. It must be unique across all devices.

*applianceInfo* is a table containing a number of required [properties](https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/docs/smart-home-skill-api-reference#discoverappliancesresponse). It must contain the following keys:

| Key | Description |
| --- | --- |
| *manufacturerName* | The name of the device manufacturer |
| *modelName* | Device model name |
| *version* | The vendor-provided version of the device |
| *friendlyName* | The name used by the customer to identify the device |
| *friendlyDescription* | A human-readable description of the device |
| *actions* | An array of actions that the device supports. The library uses the array to verify that incoming requests can be fulfilled and are supported |
| *additionalApplianceDetails* | String name/value pairs that provide additional information |

Supported actions are:

 - decrementPercentage
 - decrementTargetTemperature
 - getLockState
 - getTargetTemperature
 - getTemperatureReading
 - incrementPercentage
 - incrementTargetTemperature
 - setLockState
 - getLockState
 - setPercentage
 - setTargetTemperature
 - turnOff
 - turnOn

The *actionCallback* takes the following parameters:

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| *session* | An *AlexaSmartHomeSkill.Session* instance |
| *applianceId* | The ID of the appliance |
| *action* | The Smart Home API action |
| *[parameter]* | An optional request-specific parameter |

The *actionCallback* function is executed when a Smart Home API request is received. The application is supposed to respond to this request by calling a confirm, response or error method on the *AlexaSmartHomeSkill.Session* object passed into the callback. This response can be made asynchronously.

The library checks that appropriate confirm/response function is called in response to the incoming request: the error is returned to the application if an inappropriate function is called. Error reporting functions are also allowed to be used in response to any command.

Exceptions thrown within the *actionCallback* function are handled by the library and so don’t result in an error being sent back to the Alexa service.

*registerAppliance()* returns `null` if the verification succeeds, otherwise it returns an error description.

#### Example

```squirrel
local smartToasterInfo = {
    "actions": [
        "turnOn",
        "turnOff"
    ],
    "additionalApplianceDetails": {
        "extraDetail1": "pin1",
    },
    "friendlyDescription": "My super smart toaster",
    "friendlyName": "SmartToaster",
    "manufacturerName": "Mars Industrial",
    "modelName": "Smart Toaster 1.0",
    "version": "1.0"
};

// Callback executed upon Alexa request
local actionCallback = function(session, applianceId, action, params) {
    server.log("Got action " + action + " for " + applianceId);
    // Handle Alexa request here
}.bindenv(this);

local alexa = AlexaSmartHomeSkill();
alexa.registerAppliance("SmartToaster", smartToasterInfo, actionCallback);
```

### removeAppliance(*applianceId*)

The *removeAppliance()* method removes the device from the list of accessible appliances. All further requests to the device with the given *applianceId* will be rejected and an [UnsupportedTargetError](https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/docs/smart-home-skill-api-reference#unsupportedtargeterror) issued.

The method does not return a value. Attempts to remove an appliance that has already been removed are ignored.

## AlexaSmartHomeSkill.Session Class Usage

This class is available only through the callback function registered with *registerAppliance()*. You should not instantiate it directly. Its main purpose is to encapsulate session data and to provide a convenient way to send responses.
